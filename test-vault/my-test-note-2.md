**A Poem About Taking Notes**

Pen meets paper, thoughts take flight,
Capturing ideas in black and white.
Each word a keeper of what we've learned,
Each line a bridge to knowledge earned.

In margins wide and pages clean,
We store the wonders we have seen.
From fleeting thoughts to grand design,
Notes preserve what makes minds shine.

So scribble fast when wisdom calls,
These captured thoughts outlast us all.
For in each note, however small,
Lives proof that we have learned it all.
