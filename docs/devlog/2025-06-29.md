Even though the project was building successfully, VS Code was still showing that package modules could not be found.

I executed the following command:

```bash
yarn dlx @yarnpkg/sdks vscode
```

This modifies your .vscode/settings.json to add TypeScript compiler-wrapper inside tssdk as a Workspace TypeScript compiler.

(note: before executing this step, test whether it works without executing it, since the first time I did, it updated settings.json, which is now part of the project)

This solution came from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54954337/is-it-possible-to-use-yarn-pnp-with-typescript-vscode

---

Added optional .hooks folder and pre-commit file

---

Installee prettier and formatted all project src code with the command:

```bash
yarn prettier --write .
```

---

Refactored code to separate each tool to a separate file under the tools folder.
